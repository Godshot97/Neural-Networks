<h1>Default of credit cards payments dataset</h1>
<h2>The dataset came from: <br>https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients</h2>
<h3>Model predict if given payment in the next month will be timely or default. Prediction result depends on different variables related with clients credit history from the previous 6 months as well as on client personal data such as age or marital status.</h3>
<p>This is a continuation of a task that is in my other repository.<br><b>path to rep</b>: Machine-Learning-Algorithms / Classification / Default of credit card clients dataset</p>
<p>I used there various types of machine learning algorithms, but they did not give satisfactory results. Here I am trying to achieve a better result using the artificial neural network model.</p>
