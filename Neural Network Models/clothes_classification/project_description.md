<h1>Fashion-MNIST classifiaction dataset</h1> 
<h2>The data came from built-in keras Fashion-MNIST dataset. <br>Dataset consist of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images.</h2>

<p>The neural network receives input data in the form of 28x28 pixel photos. The Flatten input layer flattens the data to one dimension - 784 neurons (28 * 28). The SOFTMAX activation function in the output layer returns the probability of belonging to a given photo in each class.</p>
